        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, people! üëã

            Passionate about technology and programming, with solid experience in various languages and tools that dominate the world of software development. With deep knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5, I have built a career based on my passion for solving problems and creating innovative web solutions. My technological journey also includes expertise in Java, SpringBoot, PL/SQL, and Git, along with advanced skills in integration and code versioning, which are crucial for developing modern and scalable systems. üíª
            
            I believe in the power of sharing knowledge with those around me. Over the years, I have dedicated myself to mentoring and empowering other developers, always with the goal of fostering a more inclusive and collaborative programming community. For me, teaching is just as rewarding as learning, and this constant exchange keeps me motivated to improve continuously.
            
            My passion for technology is not limited to the software world. Asian culture has always fascinated me, leading me to study Korean and Japanese. In addition to my language studies, I had the opportunity to visit South Korea and Japan, where I was impressed by the incredible technological infrastructure and innovation present in both countries. This experience inspired me even more to strive for excellence in my work and explore new possibilities within the tech universe. üá∞üá∑üáØüáµ ‚ù§Ô∏è
            
            Outside of work, I have a unique hobby: robotics. I dedicate myself to learning and creating my own robotic projects, applying my knowledge of programming and electronics. Robotics is not just a passion but also a way to bring theory into practice, creating innovative and functional solutions. ü§ñüë©üèª‚Äçüíª
            
            With a curious and dedicated personality, I continue to forge my path, constantly challenging myself to learn new technologies and inspiring others to do the same. For me, technology is not just a profession but a way to connect cultures, create opportunities, and transform the future.</p>
